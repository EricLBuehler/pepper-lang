Interpreter for the [Monkey programming language](https://monkeylang.org), written in C.

This is my first C project, so expect very few best practices.

### Usage

Build the REPL: 
```
make repl
```

Build the interpreter: 
```
make monkey
```

Build & run the tests: 
```
make tests
```

Interpret a Monkey script: 
```
./bin/monkey fibonacci.monkey
```
